/*
* Aim:Programs on Classes: String and Math.
a)	Implement a Java Program to demonstrate at least 10 String methods
b)	 Implement a program that computes your initials from your full name and displays them.
c) Implement a Java Program to demonstrate at least 10 math class methods
d)  Implement a program using switch...case statement to determine the amount of electricity bill based on following logic:
	1-100 units – Rs. 6.0
	100-200 units – Rs. 7.00
	200-500 units – Rs.8.00
	more than500 – Rs.9.00
Theory:
Introduction to String and Math classes of Java
Explain at least 10 methods of each class in detail.
Conclusion: Here we have learnt String &Math classes of Java and implemented two programs as mentioned in aim of the experiment which demonstrates use of various methods of String and Math classes of Java.
